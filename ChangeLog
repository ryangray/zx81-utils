    * Add case when NXTLIN equals D_FILE and try to use the last line for
      autorun.
    * Add printing of the autorun line BASIC code to the info output.

      that the default is to include them.

      two ROM files if needed.

2024-03-07 ryangray

    * Add 'tapnoauto' utility to disable auto run on all programs in a tap file
  
2023-11-22 ryangray
    * Add 'SCR' as an address alias to 16384 for SCREEN$ data (like .scr files)
    * Also document the existing 'UDG' address alias, equivalnet to USR "a". 
    * Change header buffer from unsigned char to char to remove compile warning.
    * Added a test case for hex2tap of converting an .scr file to .tap.
    * Use smaller line reading buffers so it works under DOS

    * Add hex2tap to convert hex or binary files to a .tap file with a CODE
      block containing the bytes. Yes, this is actually a Spectrum utility.

2023-05-06 ryangray
    * Add .tap file support to rem2bin. This makes it a Spectrum crossover 
      utility. It's a small add to this, and I don't have a Spectrum utilities 
      project to put it in yet.

2023-04-23 ryangray
    * New utility, rem2bin, extracts line 1 REM machine code to a file

2023-04-22 ryangray
    * Adjustments to make p2speccy compile for DOS:
        - Make a conditional compile set of characters for code page 437 or Unicode
        - Remove using unistd.h and parse args without getopt
    * Add -o option to give output filename
    * Version 1.0.1

    * Renaming hex2rem_test.txt and hex2rem_test.bas to hex2rem.txt and 
      hex2rem.bas for the same reason.

2023-04-21 ryangray
    * p2txt and hex2rem now build for DOS using Turbo C++ 3.0
    * Changing versions to 1.0.1, for p2txt as well.

2023-04-20 ryangray
    * Add version numbers to p2txt (1.1.0) and p2spectrum (1.0.0). I'm calling
      p2txt 1.1.0 considering it to be a mod to the original that I'm treating 
      as 1.0.0. 

2023-03-28 ryangray
    * Added ZXText2P output style to p2txt via the "-2" option
    * Borrowed a few of the ZXText2P graphic escapes to replace those in the 
      "-r" readable style output.

2023-02-06 ryangray
    * Added p2spectrum utility to convert a ZX81 BASIC program in a .p file to
      a ZX Spectrum BASIC program in a text file, either zmakebas compatible or
      a readable style.
    * Updated Makefile to also make test1 for p2txt and p2spectrum. 

2023-01-05 ryangray
    * Changed the normal "readable" ouput to have more features.
    * Added an output style option that outputs characters compatible with  
      zmakebas.
