    * Adjustments to make p2speccy compile for DOS:
        - Make a conditional compile set of characters for code page 437 or Unicode
        - Remove using unistd.h and parse args without getopt
    * Add -o option to give output filename
    * Version 1.0.1

    * Changing the name of p2spectrum to p2speccy so that it is 8.3 DOS friendly
    * Renaming hex2rem_test.txt and hex2rem_test.bas to hex2rem.txt and 
      hex2rem.bas for the same reason.

    * p2txt and hex2rem now build for DOS using Turbo C++ 3.0
    * Changing versions to 1.0.1, for p2txt as well.

2023-04-20 ryangray
    * Add version numbers to p2txt (1.1.0) and p2spectrum (1.0.0). I'm calling
      p2txt 1.1.0 considering it to be a mod to the original that I'm treating 
      as 1.0.0.

    * Added ZXText2P output style to p2txt via the "-2" option
    * Borrowed a few of the ZXText2P graphic escapes to replace those in the 
      "-r" readable style output.

    * Added p2spectrum utility to convert a ZX81 BASIC program in a .p file to
      a ZX Spectrum BASIC program in a text file, either zmakebas compatible or
      a readable style.
    * Updated Makefile to also make test1 for p2txt and p2spectrum. 

2023-01-05 ryangray
    * Changed the normal "readable" ouput to have more features.
    * Added an output style option that outputs characters compatible with  
      zmakebas.
